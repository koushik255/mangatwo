ok, so what if i had something which basiclaly you set it up in a vps
it would donwload the torrent episode or whatever and then you would be able to stream the video 
back to your computer,and then you could just watch it and then when the torrent complete you can delete it,


ok it would connect to a vps and for this example you would have 1 show on the vps at a time
then when you would want to watch the show it would start streaming it from vps to the site but it would all 
be hosted on the vps so it would be very quick right? 

cause i really could care less about code nowadays dude  
ok i should set up anki tbf


so vps would be running like low but then when it gets a request/password is correct when user logs in
it has the site their so its chill but also 
it would then just locally stream the video from like computer to web
yeah the back/front end would just stream the video, and you would have it running on your vps,/domain

but why would somebody not just stream it, i really should just delve into video streaming instead of database
stuff because at least with video stremaing and all this bs its stuff in place wtvr besides the point

ok so i either make a manga site or i do this, manga site it aucallty way easier and i just have to scale it 
i could do manga site first then do that 

learn how to turn my stuff on computer into links
ok so that is very possible so that good

ok so instead of hosting stuff on the cloud i could do it 
locally on my computer and then make it so that the vps would be able to access 
that file base/ ssh into it becuase it would be serving those images 
and then like first i could just work on getting like the top 5 manga on mal but then i could like 
keep expanding and expanding and honeslty since most people just want to read the most popular ones of 
all time we dont need to have every single manga of all time since idgaf about those people
then from their 

ok so plan

for now i guess i can just have the files in the vps 
but ok 
have the files globaly served
also host a frontend from the vps and backedn 
then you would just be able to view the manga on the site pretty fine 
then instead of using something like convex i could have the manga which is being read in readis and then 
the rest in sqlite, but thats alot maybe not just have sqlite for now tbh



ok thats a good step to do tommorow, becuase im acuallty done with bs like cloudflare when stuff like that is 
totally unnesscarty for my scale
